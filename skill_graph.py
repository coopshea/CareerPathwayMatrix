                                3. Prioritizes skills based on job market demand and learning efficiency
                                4. Suggests a clear sequence that minimizes learning time while maximizing job market value
                                5. Includes specific learning resources (courses, books, projects)
                                6. Provides a realistic timeline
                                
                                Use the skill graph concept to identify logical skill relationships and progressions.
