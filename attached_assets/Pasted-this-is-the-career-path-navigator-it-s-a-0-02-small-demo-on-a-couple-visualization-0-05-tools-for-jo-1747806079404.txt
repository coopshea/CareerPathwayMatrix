this is the career path navigator it's a
0:02
small demo on a couple visualization
0:05
tools for job hunting based on some of
0:08
the parts that I found really unpleasant
0:11
so the basic idea
0:13
is to go from your background where you
0:16
are currently to where you want to be
0:17
and help map the area between um and
0:21
streamline that process and make sure
0:23
that the job seeker is is focused and on
0:26
task and working in the most efficient
0:29
way possible to move towards their goals
0:31
as quickly as
0:33
possible so in line with that the
0:36
functionality is based around a skill
0:38
map so you'll upload a resume personal
0:41
writing portfolio you name it and it'll
0:44
go ahead and extract all the text and
0:47
also extract and rate your skills in
0:50
different areas so for me it's a lot of
0:51
random uh engineering
0:53
work and you do the exact same thing for
0:56
jobs you're excited about so I went
0:59
ahead and I added a product manager
1:01
consumer growth position at Anthropic
1:04
and it correctly recognizes I don't have
1:06
a lot of the background for this
1:09
so the challenge I found personally is
1:11
there are a lot of jobs I'm potentially
1:13
really excited about but don't really
1:15
have a lot of the background for and
1:18
don't really know exactly how to get
1:19
there so this is designed to to help
1:21
move you in that direction and
1:23
understand what what you're missing and
1:25
how to get there
1:27
so it'll create a map of your background
1:31
uh your skills and it'll also create a
1:34
map of the requirements they're looking
1:36
for and anywhere there's some overlap so
1:38
in this case some Python understanding
1:41
it will connect the dots now ultimately
1:44
the the vision is to use this tool to be
1:46
able to interpolate so let's say
1:49
I need some practice with doing
1:52
technical demonstrations so I mean I
1:55
guess that's kind of what I'm doing
1:56
right now but you can go ahead and add
1:59
your own experiences uh to the to the
2:01
skill skill road map um and and populate
2:05
them in or you can go ahead and and have
2:09
the tool help uh interpolate for you so
2:11
what it'll do is if you say upload three
2:13
four or five jobs anything that shows up
2:16
multiple times it will highlight as you
2:18
know really valuable it's really worth
2:20
your time to learn SQL if that shows up
2:22
in every job you want to work at so as
2:25
someone who wants to develop into roles
2:28
they may not be you know totally
2:29
prepared for this helps you plot a
2:31
course uh you know the the most
2:33
efficient course for for gaining those
2:35
skills and being
2:37
prepared so it will allow you to you
2:40
know you know interpolate that's kind of
2:42
the whole function of this area
2:45
now the second feature which hopefully I
2:47
haven't grayed out for this entire demo
2:50
is a portfolio uh so it allows you to
2:54
essentially showcase mastery of
2:56
different skills or different things
2:57
you're learning you know record the
2:59
project the description add any GitHub
3:02
or images PowerPoint whatever whatever
3:04
to uh to showcase your work and the
3:08
purpose of this is not to have a
3:10
beautiful portfolio website uh to share
3:12
but to prepare for an interview so let's
3:16
say I I got an interview for that job I
3:18
was excited about i've populated in a
3:20
bunch of
3:21
projects what I can do is really hone
3:23
the story I want to tell my experiences
3:26
what I learned how I faced problems and
3:28
solve them um you know how I am as a
3:30
team player all that kind of stuff and
3:31
it enables you to to really have that
3:33
story down before you go into an
3:35
interview and have it all in a
3:37
centralized location so yeah there'll be
3:39
you know whatever portfolio projects you
3:40
add you can go and review those now the
3:43
long-term vision is to take something
3:45
like that and hook it up to an interview
3:46
coach something that knows where you
3:48
want to work it knows your background
3:50
and it can act as an interviewer and
3:53
help you gain that confidence uh in the
3:55
roles uh that you're looking to uh to
3:59
apply for
4:02
the uh you know other features we're
4:04
looking at are a job tracker just a
4:06
centralized hub for what you've applied
4:08
for maybe with a Gmail integration you
4:10
know make sure that you're not missing
4:12
any outbound that kind of thing and then
4:14
also there is a a third aspect which is
4:16
this find your pathway tool which is
4:20
rather than kind of a mapping of your
4:22
background and your skills to a a job
4:24
you've picked this is more exploratory
4:25
so it has a repository of a bunch of
4:28
different jobs ranked on different
4:29
metrics like risk or you know being
4:32
pigeonholed into a certain skill set or
4:34
you know pay
4:36
uh maybe like uh mission for climate or
4:40
uh medicine or something else and it
4:43
enables you to input you know through a
4:45
questionnaire some of your own values
4:47
your own background and then it will
4:49
kind of give you a score of how
4:51
important those things are to you based
4:52
on what you filled out and what that
4:54
enables is this other tool which is this
4:56
2x two matrix tool that can kind of map
4:59
you to things you maybe hadn't
5:00
considered that really match your
5:02
background who you are personally the
5:04
kind of you know pay you require
5:06
whatever so that's kind of the the plan
5:09
for this and uh really excited to have
5:12
everyone try it out and get feedback
5:14
it's a definitely a demo so excited to
5:16
have everyone break it and and uh help
5:19
build it with me
5:21
so have fun
