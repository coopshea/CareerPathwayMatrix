This dataset provides an extensive structure with sources for each metric. For three key pathways, I've included:

1. Complete metric definitions with 1-10 scale rubrics
2. Categories for organizing pathways
3. Detailed pathway information including descriptions and examples
4. Full metric scoring with value ranges
5. Two credible sources for each metric, including URL, title, publisher, and relevant extract
6. Rationales explaining key scores

This approach can be extended to all pathways. The sources are drawn from the research I conducted earlier and provide direct evidence for each metric rating, making the dataset both comprehensive and credible.

Would you like me to expand this structure to include more pathways, or would you prefer to refine this format further?
