  "tool_purpose": {
    "primary_goal": "To provide a systematic framework for evaluating different wealth-building career pathways to achieve $10 million within 5-10 years",
    "forecasting_approach": "Based on Paul Saffo's scenario mapping methodology that identifies key parameters and explores their relationships through 2x2 matrices",
    "expected_value_framework": "Combines probability of success with potential outcomes to create comparable metrics across diverse pathways",
    "decision_support": "Helps users identify pathways aligned with their personal skills, risk tolerance, and preferences rather than prescribing a single 'best' option",
    "vision": "To transform career decision-making from intuition-based to data-informed while preserving personal agency",
    "unique_value": "Most career guidance focuses on incremental advancement or passion-following. This tool specifically addresses substantial wealth creation as a primary goal, allowing for clear-eyed evaluation of tradeoffs."
  },
  "educational_content": {
    "intro_text": "This visualization tool applies forecasting methodology to map potential pathways to $10 million in wealth. By systematically analyzing 18 different parameters—from risk level to knowledge half-life—across diverse career options, it helps identify which paths align with your personal circumstances and preferences. The tool doesn't just show what's possible; it helps you understand the tradeoffs inherent in each choice.",
    "theoretical_foundation": "This approach is inspired by forecaster Paul Saffo's methodologies, which use parameter mapping to plot potential futures based on key variables. By visualizing career options on 2x2 matrices, we can identify clusters of opportunity and better understand the relationships between different variables like risk and reward, time investment and expected value, or control and scalability.",
    "expected_value_explanation": "The tool incorporates an expected value framework that multiplies potential returns by probability of success. For example, a pathway with a 1% chance of yielding $10 million has an expected value of $100,000. This allows for comparing dissimilar options on a level playing field. While an entrepreneurial path might have low probability but high ceiling, a specialized professional path might offer more certainty with a lower maximum return.",

        "topic": "Risk Tolerance",
        "question": "Think about past career decisions. How did you feel when taking risks versus pursuing safer options? Did you feel more energized by stability or by potential upside?",

      },
      {
        "topic": "Technical Specialization",
        "question": "Consider times when you've deeply specialized versus remained a generalist. Which approach felt more natural to you?",

      },
      {
        "topic": "Time Horizon",
        "question": "Reflect on your patience with delayed gratification. Are you willing to invest years before seeing significant returns?",
        "relevance": "Pathways differ dramatically in how quickly they deliver financial returns."
      },
      {
        "topic": "Control vs. Optionality",
        "question": "Consider situations where you had to choose between maintaining full control and preserving future options. Which did you prioritize?",
        "relevance": "Certain paths offer greater autonomy while others maintain flexibility to pivot."
      },
      {
        "topic": "Network Reliance",
        "question": "How comfortable are you with success depending on your ability to build and leverage professional relationships?",
        "relevance": "Pathways vary significantly in their dependency on networks and connections."
      }
    ],
    "methodology_note": "This tool combines research from hundreds of sources including industry reports, academic studies, and career outcome data. Each pathway is scored on a 1-10 scale across multiple dimensions, with sources and evidence provided for transparency.",
    "how_to_use": "Start by exploring the 2x2 matrix to compare pathways along different dimensions. Then, use the preference sliders to input your own priorities and constraints. The tool will calculate which pathways best match your profile and highlight them for deeper exploration."

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **App Structure**
   - Create a sidebar for filters, user preferences, and navigation
   - Main area for visualization and detailed pathway information
   - Use tabs to organize different views (2x2 Matrix, Recommendations, About)

2. **Key Visualization Components**
   - Main 2x2 matrix visualization using matplotlib or plotly
   - Interactive parameter selectors for axes
   - Pathway detail view with expandable sections
   - User preference input section with sliders and explanations
   - Category and parameter filters

3. **Core User Experience Flow**
   - Start with an introduction explaining the purpose and methodology
   - Guide users to explore the 2x2 matrix to understand the landscape
   - Prompt reflection on personal preferences through guided questions
   - Allow users to input their preferences with clear explanations of each parameter
   - Generate personalized recommendations with explanations of why each pathway matches
   - Enable exploration of specific pathways with detailed information and sources

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Load the complete pathway dataset with all metrics and sources
   - Implement interactive visualization with proper scaling and labeling
   - Create preference input controls with descriptions from rubrics
   - Build recommendation algorithm to match user preferences with pathways
   - Design responsive layouts that work on different screen sizes

The app should emphasize that it's not just a visualization tool but a decision-making framework, helping users systematically explore options while grounding choices in data and research. The focus should be on revealing tradeoffs between different pathways rather than prescribing a single "best" option.
