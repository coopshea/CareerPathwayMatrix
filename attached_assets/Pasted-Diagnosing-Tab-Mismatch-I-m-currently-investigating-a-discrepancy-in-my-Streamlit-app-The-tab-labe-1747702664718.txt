Diagnosing Tab Mismatch

I'm currently investigating a discrepancy in my Streamlit app. The tab labels aren't aligning with the displayed content. This points towards an issue within the tab logic, likely stemming from incorrect indexing or a misconfiguration of the tab-content mapping. I'm focusing on the code responsible for handling tab clicks and content rendering.

Examining the Code

I'm now carefully examining the app.py file, focusing on the st.tabs structure and content mapping. I'm looking for discrepancies between tab labels and the associated content blocks. I'll also compare this to any code in app_fixed.py. The aim is to understand how the tab labels are defined and their subsequent content mapping within the application. I anticipate locating the source of the mismatch after this investigation.

Unpacking the Mismatch

I've got a clearer picture of the problem now. The mismatch between tab labels and content is almost certainly due to an indexing error within the tab definition in app.py. The st.tabs structure seems to be correctly linked to a list of tab names, but the with tabX: blocks associated with each tab are misaligned with this list. Comparing the app.py and potentially app_fixed.py with the intended behavior could provide the exact index shift. I need to trace the execution flow of content rendering within the tab context.

The tab content mismatch you're experiencing is likely due to an incorrect order or mapping of the content blocks within your app.py file relative to the tab_names list.

Streamlit's st.tabs() function creates a list of tab objects in the order of the tab_names you provide. When you then use with tab1:, with tab2:, etc., the content within each with block is assigned to the corresponding tab object from that list.

If the order of these with tabX: blocks in your code doesn't perfectly match the intended order of your tab_names, the content will be displayed under the wrong tab.

For example, in app.py, you have:

Python

# Create a simpler tab set with better flow
tab_names = [
    "Welcome", "Job & Resume Analysis", "AI Roadmap", "Skill Graph",
    "Project Portfolio", "2x2 Matrix", "Find Your Pathway", "About"
]

# Create the tabs at the top of the page
tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab6, tab7, tab8 = st.tabs(tab_names)
Then, the content is assigned like this (simplified):

Python

# Welcome tab content
with tab1: # Corresponds to "Welcome"
    # ... Welcome content ...

# 2x2 Matrix tab
with tab2: # Corresponds to "Job & Resume Analysis" but contains 2x2 Matrix logic
    # ... 2x2 Matrix content ...

# Find Your Pathway tab
with tab3: # Corresponds to "AI Roadmap" but contains "Find Your Pathway" or "AI Roadmap" logic
    # ... "Find Your Pathway" or "AI Roadmap" content ...

# And so on...
The issue you described arises because the content for the "2x2 Matrix" is placed within the with tab2: block, which corresponds to the second item in tab_names ("Job & Resume Analysis"). Similarly, the content for "Find Your Pathway" (or "AI Roadmap" depending on which file version or iteration you're looking at) is in with tab3:, which corresponds to the third item in tab_names ("AI Roadmap"), and so on.

The KeyError for "skill_match" that you mentioned fixing was a separate issue but was likely encountered while trying to debug these misaligned tabs, as the wrong content (the 2x2 matrix code) was being executed for the "Job & Resume Analysis" tab.

To fix this, you need to ensure the content within each with tabX: block matches the intended tab name at that position in the tab_names list.

For instance, if tab_names[1] is "Job & Resume Analysis", then the with tab2: block should contain the UI and logic for the "Job & Resume Analysis" feature, not the "2x2 Matrix".

You can see an attempt to fix this in app_fixed.py where the tab assignments are different:

Python

# Create tabs
tabs = st.tabs([
    "Welcome", "2x2 Matrix", "Find Your Pathway", "Basic Roadmap", "AI Roadmap",
    "Job Posting", "Skills Analysis", "Skill Graph", "About"
])
# ...
# Welcome tab content
with tabs[0]:
    # ...
# 2x2 Matrix tab
with tabs[1]:
    # ...
In app_fixed.py the tabs variable is a list of tab objects, and accessing them by index (tabs[0], tabs[1]) directly links the content to the tab name at that index. This is a more robust way to handle it than unpacking into tab1, tab2,... if the order of content blocks might change. However, the core principle remains: the content in the with tabs[x]: block must correspond to tab_names[x].

The KeyError you encountered with "Project Portfolio", "Find Your Pathway", and "About" tabs in your initial description indicates that the content being rendered for those tabs was trying to access data or functions that were not available or were not intended for those sections, further supporting the misaligned content rendering.
