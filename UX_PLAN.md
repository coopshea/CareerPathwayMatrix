# CareerPath Navigator: User Experience Plan

## Landing Page Design

### Purpose
Create a simple, welcoming landing page that clearly communicates what CareerPath Navigator does and helps users quickly navigate to the specific feature that addresses their needs.

### Key Elements

1. **Brief Introduction**
   - Simple headline: "Navigate Your Career Journey"
   - Short description (1-2 sentences): "Find the right career path, identify valuable skills, and create your roadmap to success."
   - Target audience statement: "For professionals at any stage seeking clarity and direction in their career journey."

2. **Common User Scenarios as Action Buttons**
   Each button addresses a specific pain point and links directly to the relevant feature:

   - "I'm considering a career change and want to explore options" → Career Matrix
   - "I want to understand what skills I have and what I need" → Skills Profile
   - "I need to evaluate if a job posting matches my career goals" → Job Posting Analysis
   - "I want to create a roadmap to acquire new skills" → Skill Roadmap
   - "I'm not sure which career paths match my preferences" → Recommendations
   - "I want to track projects that demonstrate my skills" → Portfolio

3. **AI Chat Helper**
   - Conversation starter: "I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Can you help me?"
   - AI has context about all features to guide users to the right section
   - Asks clarifying questions about user's situation and goals
   - Provides personalized recommendations for which feature to use

4. **Visual Simplicity**
   - Clean, distraction-free design
   - No technical parameters or complex inputs on landing page
   - Consistent color scheme with clear action buttons
   - Optional: Simple illustrations representing each main feature

## AI Chat Assistant Implementation

### Context to Provide the AI:
- Complete description of all features and their purposes
- Common user scenarios and pain points
- Decision tree for recommending features
- Sample questions to ask users based on their needs

### Sample Dialogue Flows:

**Example 1: Career Explorer**
```
User: I'm not sure what I'm looking for.
AI: I'd be happy to help you find what you need! Are you currently:
    1. Exploring new career options
    2. Looking to develop specific skills
    3. Evaluating job opportunities
    4. Building a professional portfolio
User: I'm thinking about changing careers but I'm not sure what would be a good fit.
AI: That's a significant decision! The Career Matrix would be most helpful for you right now. It allows you to:
    - Compare different career pathways visually
    - See how options rate on factors like income, satisfaction, and growth
    - Filter by your interests and priorities
    Would you like me to take you to the Career Matrix page?
```

**Example 2: Skill Developer**
```
User: I need help figuring out what skills to learn.
AI: I can definitely help with that! To give you the best guidance, I need to know a bit more:
    - Do you already have a target career or job in mind?
    - Have you uploaded your resume or created a skills profile?
User: I have a job posting for a data analyst role that I'm interested in.
AI: Great! I recommend using our Job Posting Analysis feature first to extract the required skills, then comparing those to your own Skills Profile. This will help identify any gaps. Would you like to:
    1. Analyze a job posting first
    2. Update your skills profile first
    3. See both side by side
```
